## 🔒 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of binding data and the methods that manipulate that data into a single unit — usually a class. It helps protect the internal state of an object and restricts unauthorized access.

---

## 🔁 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. It enables methods to have different behaviors depending on the object that is calling them. Supports **compile-time** and **runtime** versions.

---

## 🧬 Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It promotes code reuse and represents a **"is-a"** relationship between base and derived classes.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary parts. It simplifies code by separating **what** an object does from **how** it does it.

---

## 📃 Interface

An interface defines a contract that classes can implement. It contains method and property signatures without implementation, enabling multiple inheritance and abstraction in a clean and modular way.

---

## ⚙️ Static Keyword

The `static` keyword indicates that a member belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific instance. Static methods and variables are shared across all instances and are accessed directly via the class.

---

## 🧩 Partial Keyword

The `partial` keyword allows a class or struct to be split across multiple files. It’s useful for managing large classes and for collaborative development, as all parts are combined during compilation.

---

## 🚫 Sealed Keyword

The `sealed` keyword prevents other classes from inheriting from a class. It helps protect code from being extended or modified and may offer performance benefits.

---

## 🏷️ Properties

Properties are class members that provide controlled access to fields. They encapsulate a getter and/or setter, making it easier to manage how values are accessed or modified.
